#LearnDash

BuddyBoss Platform has fully integrated LearnDash functions and features to create a seamless environment for site members. The problem is how LearnDash has it's own groups utilized for courses. BuddyBoss Platform also has groups which allow members to organize themselves and have separate discussions, activity feed and even forums.

The solution is to sync groups between the two.
