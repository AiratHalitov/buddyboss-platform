General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is the most important change in data privacy regulation that site admins must comply with. It requires companies and site owners to be transparent about how they collect, use, and share personal data. It also gives individuals more access and choice when it comes to how their own personal data is collected, used, and shared. See how members can request and download a copy of their personal data.

See our [bp_docs_link text="Registration Pages" slug="components/registration/registration-pages.md"] tutorial for how to require Privacy Policy and Terms of Service during registration, another requirement for GDPR compliant websites.
