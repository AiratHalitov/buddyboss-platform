#View As Member

Site administrators have many additional tools and options than members do not have access. This can make things difficult if admins cannot replicate the same issue due to permissions. To help troubleshoot admins have the ability to view the site as any member. Simply navigate to any member profile and click "View As" to view the site as that member with their permissions.

To switch back you can click on "Back to Admin" in the member profile or click "Switch back to Admin" on the admin toolbar.
