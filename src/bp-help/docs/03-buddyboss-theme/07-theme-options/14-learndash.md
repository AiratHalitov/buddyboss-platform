##LearnDash 3.0

Our BuddyBoss Theme is designed to make LearnDash look beautiful, and it requires [LearnDash 3.0](https://www.learndash.com/best-wordpress-lms-plugin/) or above in order to work properly. LearnDash 2.0 and below uses a now "Legacy" template pack which is not compatible with our new BuddyBoss Theme. Once LearnDash 3.0 is installed, you will need to go to LearnDash > Settings > General, and make sure to set the "Active Template" to LearnDash 3.0.
