#Translating Text and Labels

You might want to change the text, labels and messages seen throughout BuddyBoss Theme, for example if your site is in another language. This page explains how to use a language translation file to customize all text instances found in BuddyBoss Theme. You **do not** want to modify the text in the code of the actual theme, as it will all be removed as soon as you update the theme. You need to modify text using the included language translation files. This is the same method used in all WordPress plugins.

###Automatic Translation via Loco Translate

We recommend using [Loco Translate](https://wordpress.org/plugins/loco-translate/) plugin to translate all text found in the BuddyBoss Theme language files.
