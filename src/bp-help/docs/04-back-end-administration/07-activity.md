#Activity

BuddyBoss Platform provides admin dashboard panels to help you manage activities published throughout the site, just like other content. This screen has the same customization as similar pages.

Activities can be generated by BuddyBoss Platform or by third party plugins. To more effectively manage different activity types us the filter drop-down to narrow your selection.

Each activity displays the author, submit date & time, content, action and if it was in response to another activity.
