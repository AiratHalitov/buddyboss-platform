#Repair Forums

BuddyBoss keeps track of relationships between forums, discussions, replies, discussion tags, and users. Occasionally these relationships become out of sync, most often after an import or migration. Use the tools to recalculate these relationships.

Dashboard -> BuddyBoss -> Tools -> Repair Forums

NOTE: Some of these tools create substantial database resources. Avoid running more than 1 repair job at a time.
