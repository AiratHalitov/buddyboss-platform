#Tools

BuddyBoss Platform comes with tools to help you manage your database, the core component to WordPress and BuddyBoss Platform. These tools automate scripts to repair your community & forums as well as import forums & profile types.

*   Repair Community - BuddyBoss Platform keeps track to relationships between members, groups and activity items. Sometimes they get out of sync and must be manually adjusted.
*   Repair Forums - Just like your community forum components may become out of sync and must be manually adjusted.
*   Import Forums - Import your forums from a variety of platforms.
*   Import Profile Types - If you manually created a member type with BuddyPress this tool will import them to manage within BuddyBoss Platform.
