#Import Profile Types

Import Profile Types from BuddyPress. You may have created these types **manually via code** or by using a **third party plugin**. Click “Run Migration” and all of the registered member types will be imported into the BuddyBoss Platform. Then you can disable and remove the old code or plugin.
