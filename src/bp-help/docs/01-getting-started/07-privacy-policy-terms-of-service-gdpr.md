#Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, GDPR

As a website owner, you may need to follow national or international privacy laws. For example, you may need to create and display a Privacy Policy.

After your Privacy Policy page is set, we suggest that you edit it. We would also suggest reviewing your Privacy Policy from time to time, especially after installing or updating any themes or plugins. There may be changes or new suggested information for you to consider adding to your policy.

Registration
------------

By creating privacy policy and terms of service pages your registration page will automatically require users to accept your TOS and/or Privacy Policy. If you only have one of these pages then the other page will not be added to your registration page.

GDPR
----

General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is the most important change in data privacy regulation that site admins must comply. It requires companies and site owners to be transparent about how they collect, use, and share personal data. It also gives individuals more access and choice when it comes to how their own personal data is collected, used, and shared. See how members can request and download a copy of their personal data below.
