#Getting Started


Welcome to BuddyPress Platform! This section will help you setup you new BuddyBoss-powered site. As administrator you will need to install and configure settings to manage members, social groups, activity feeds, and other BuddyBoss components. To run BuddyBoss Platform here are some guidelines.

Required Server Software Packages
---------------------------------

*   PHP version 5.4 or greater
*   MySQL version 5.6 or greater
*   WordPress version 4.5 or greater - We recommend installing WordPress manually and NOT via a hosting provider self-install (e.g. fantastico, softalicious, etc.)
*   Apache Module mod\_rewrite
*   PHP GD or imagick modules - WordPress will fail to create images and will NOT show an error
*   AllowOverride should be set to All in folders where .htaccess is located

Before Installing We Recommend
------------------------------

*   [bp_docs_link text="Backing up your database and files" slug="05-maintenance/01-backing-up-your-database-and-files.md"]
*   VPS Hosting or better - BuddyBoss powered websites increase server resource load exponentially with each new member
