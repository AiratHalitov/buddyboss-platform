#Social Groups

Social groups allows users to organize themselves into specific public, private or hidden social areas with separate activity feeds and member listings. Social group organizers can approve requests to join the group, invite other users to join the group, change the group photo/cover image, promote group members, remove group members and enable separate group discussion forum.
