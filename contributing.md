# BuddyBoss Platform Contributing Guide

Before submitting your contribution, please make sure to take a moment and read through the following guidelines.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Checkout a topic branch from `dev` and merge back against `dev`.
    - If you are not familiar with branching please read [_A successful Git branching model_](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) before you go any further.
- Follow our [branch naming standards](https://github.com/buddyboss/buddyboss-platform/wiki/BuddyBoss-Platform-Git-Flow#branch-naming).
- Follow the [WordPress Coding Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/coding-standards/).
- Make sure the default `grunt` task passes.
- After creating branch, make a code review request for that branch first so that we know you are working on this feature or fix.
- Release branch will only contain latest `dev` branch changes and whatever changes done for the hotfixes for the release.
- When committing, reference your issue number (#1234) and include a note about the fix.
- Ensure that your code supports the minimum supported versions of PHP and WordPress; this is shown at the top of the readme.txt file.
